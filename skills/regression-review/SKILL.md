description: Perform a scoped, coverage-led review of working tree, staged, commit-range, branch, or PR changes to find user-visible behavioral regressions. Use when Codex must audit code changes for broken or degraded user journeys, changed defaults, loading/error/permission/session behavior, stale data, ordering, retries, duplicate/destructive actions, exported output, emails, CLI output, or other visible behavior, and must write a Markdown report that enumerates all distinct findings discovered within the reviewed scope plus coverage gaps and intentional visible changes.

# Regression Review

## Overview

Treat the change set as a scoped user-visible regression audit with a gate recommendation. The primary job is to enumerate every distinct user-visible regression finding that can be reasonably identified within the reviewed scope, not only the most severe or easiest findings.

Always produce a Markdown report file and a short terminal summary.

Keep the overall recommendation mechanically aligned with the highest-severity unresolved finding and the coverage state. Do not let prose tone drift the gate up or down.

## Set Scope First

- Prefer an explicit scope from the user: working tree, staged changes, last commit, commit range, branch diff, or PR.
- If the user does not specify scope, default to staged changes when they exist; otherwise compare the current working tree against `HEAD` and state that assumption in the report.
- If the requested scope is too large to review completely in one pass, do not silently sample it. Review the highest-risk surfaces first, mark the report `Incomplete`, list the exact files or surfaces not covered, and set the recommendation no lower than `Discuss` unless the uncovered area is demonstrably non-user-visible.
- If requirements, issue text, a PR description, or a design doc exist, read them before judging regressions.
- Separate intended product changes from accidental regressions.

## Completeness Contract

- Output every distinct regression finding discovered within the reviewed scope. Do not stop after the top 3.
- Use `Must-review now` only as a short priority preview. The full findings sections and `Complete Findings Index` must include all findings.
- Maintain a `Coverage Ledger` that maps every touched user-visible surface to one of:
  - `Finding F#`
  - `Intentional I#`
  - `Reviewed - no user-visible regression found`
  - `Not user-visible`
  - `Not covered`
- Do not drop lower-severity user-visible changes. Put them in `Watch` or `Intentional Changes` when they are real but not blocking.
- If a candidate issue is investigated and dismissed, record the dismissal in the evidence appendix when it explains coverage or prevents duplicate review.
- If token budget, runtime setup, missing credentials, or diff size prevents complete coverage, say exactly where coverage stopped. A partial review must not be presented as complete.

## Output Rules

- Always write a Markdown file.
- If the repo already has an obvious location for reviews or reports, follow that convention.
- Otherwise write to `tmp/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-user-visible-regression-report.md`.
- End with a short terminal summary that includes the report path, the gate recommendation, completion status, counts by action, and the top risks.
- Structure the report in this order:
  - `Scope`
  - `Gate Snapshot`
  - `Complete Findings Index`
  - `Block`
  - `Discuss`
  - `Watch`
  - `Intentional Changes`
  - `Coverage Ledger`
  - `Evidence Appendix`
- Keep the primary view optimized for review reading speed, but do not omit findings for brevity.
- Do not use wide summary tables as the main presentation shape for finding details. Tables are appropriate for the findings index, coverage ledger, and evidence appendix.

## Review Actions

Use these action labels as the primary classification:

- `Block`
  - Strong evidence or strong risk that a user-visible behavior is broken, degraded, or dangerously changed.
  - A reviewer should stop the change from shipping until the issue is fixed or disproven.
- `Discuss`
  - The user-visible impact may be meaningful, but severity, intent, or actual runtime effect is still unclear.
  - A reviewer should raise it in review and resolve the uncertainty before approval.
- `Watch`
  - The behavior change is worth noticing, but does not justify blocking by itself.
  - A reviewer may approve with caveat, added test, follow-up, or monitoring.
- `Intentional`
  - The user-visible change appears deliberate and should not be framed as a regression.

Do not use `confirmed`, `probable`, or `possible` as top-level groupings. Keep them as evidence language inside the card when useful.

## Recommendation Mapping

Use the top-level `Recommendation` field in `Gate Snapshot` with this exact mapping:

- If any unresolved finding is `Block`, the report recommendation MUST be `Block`.
- Else if any unresolved finding is `Discuss`, the report recommendation MUST be `Discuss`.
- Else if coverage is incomplete for a user-visible or unknown-impact surface, the report recommendation MUST be `Discuss`.
- Else if any unresolved finding is `Watch`, the report recommendation MUST be `Pass with caveat`.
- Else use `Pass`.

Additional rules:

- Do not write `Pass with caveat` when a `Discuss` item is still open.
- Do not write `Discuss` when the body contains no `Discuss` items and no incomplete user-visible coverage.
- If a suspected issue lacks enough proof to justify `Block`, downgrade the finding to `Discuss` instead of keeping `Block` with hand-wavy evidence.
- If the report contains both `Block` and `Discuss`, keep both sections, but the top-level recommendation remains `Block`.

## What Counts As One Finding

- Count one item per distinct user-facing outcome, not per file, function, root cause, or code smell.
- Merge multiple code changes that lead to the same user-visible symptom.
- Split items when different user journeys are affected in materially different ways.
- Focus on findings that matter during review:
  - broken or degraded task completion
  - changed defaults or fallback behavior
  - loading, empty, or error state changes
  - permission or session behavior changes
  - stale data, cache, retry, polling, or ordering changes
  - destructive, repeated, or duplicate actions
  - accessibility, keyboard, focus, or responsive behavior changes that users can notice
  - output changes in emails, generated files, CLI output, API responses, persisted data, or exports

## Evidence Standard

- Prefer the strongest feasible evidence for the affected surface, not one fixed verification mode.
- Runtime checks are valuable, but they are not mandatory when static path tracing or output inspection already provides strong evidence.
- For frontend behavior, use the evidence that best matches the risk: code-path tracing, generated output inspection, logs, focused tests, screenshots, or runtime repro when needed.
- For non-UI changes, inspect outputs, fixtures, generated files, CLI responses, API responses, logs, and focused tests.
- If evidence is missing, lower confidence and say so plainly.
- Separate verified facts from inferred consequences.
- Do not present speculation as fact.
- Do not treat `eslint`, `typecheck`, or passing unrelated tests as proof that a user-visible regression is disproven. They are hygiene evidence only.
- When a spec, issue, or design doc exists, use it to judge intent, but do not treat it as proof that the runtime or output behavior is still correct.

## Workflow

1. Define the comparison baseline.
   - Use the user-specified scope exactly when provided.
   - Otherwise use staged changes if present; if nothing is staged, use working tree against `HEAD`.
   - Record the exact scope and baseline in the report.
2. Build a diff inventory.
   - List touched files and classify each as user-visible surface, user-visible dependency, test-only, docs-only, generated, config, or unknown.
   - Use repository structure, route maps, exports, commands, schedules, feature flags, and call sites to avoid missing indirect user-visible paths.
3. Build the coverage ledger before writing findings.
   - Identify every route, page, component, API consumer, command, job, config default, flag path, email/export/output, and persisted side effect touched by the diff.
   - Add each surface to the ledger even if it later has no finding.
4. Trace behavior deltas for every ledger surface.
   - Compare before and after behavior for each surface.
   - Look for removed guards, changed branching, altered ordering, serialization changes, loading changes, empty states, error paths, retries, cache keys, stale data, session/auth checks, and output formatting.
   - For refactors, wrappers, adapters, shared utilities, or "just telemetry" changes, explicitly trace what now supplies the user-visible input, what still enforces guards, and what produces the final output.
5. Gather proof and code pointers.
   - Collect the strongest runtime, output, test, log, fixture, screenshot, or code-path evidence available.
   - Trace each finding back to concrete code lines.
6. De-duplicate and classify.
   - Merge candidates with the same user-facing outcome.
   - Rank within each section by user impact first, confidence second.
7. Write the report from `references/report-template.md`.
   - Include all findings in `Complete Findings Index` and the matching action sections.
   - Put priority highlights in `Must-review now`, but never use that list as the full result.
8. Run the report self-check.
   - Every touched user-visible surface is present in `Coverage Ledger`.
   - Every finding in the action sections appears in `Complete Findings Index`.
   - Every `Finding F#` in `Coverage Ledger` has a matching card.
   - Every `Not covered` row has a reason and a concrete next step.
   - The recommendation matches the mapping rules.

## Card Format

Each risk should be written as a short review card, not a spreadsheet row. Repeat the card format for every finding in the section; do not cap sections at one item.

Use this shape:

```md
### F1 Block - Checkout can submit twice

User impact: Users can trigger duplicate payment attempts during a slow checkout.
Review reason: Direct money-path risk with obvious user-facing failure.
Surface: Checkout submit flow
Confidence: High

Look here first:
- [submit handler](/abs/path/app/checkout.tsx#L128)
- [removed guard](/abs/path/lib/payment.ts#L42)

Behavior delta:
- Before: First submit disabled repeat submission while the request was pending.
- After: Repeat clicks can issue another submission before the first request finishes.

Evidence:
- Reproduced locally in browser with throttled network.
- No remaining test covering duplicate submit protection.

Reviewer action:
Block until the guard is restored or equivalent idempotency is proven elsewhere.
```

## Writing Rules

- Start with the gate decision and completion status.
- `Gate Snapshot` should fit on one screen when possible.
- `Gate Snapshot` should usually include:
  - `Recommendation`
  - `Completion`
  - `Why now`
  - `Must-review now`
  - `Findings count`
  - `Coverage confidence`
  - `Biggest blind spot`
- Limit `Must-review now` to the top 3 items, and explicitly point to `Complete Findings Index` for the full list.
- In each review card, keep the first sentence about user impact, not code mechanics.
- Use exactly 1 or 2 links under `Look here first`.
- Put the full causal chain in `Evidence Appendix`, not in the main card.
- Use absolute file paths when the environment supports clickable local links. Include line anchors when available, for example `[checkout.tsx](/abs/path/app/checkout.tsx#L128)` or `[checkout.tsx](/abs/path/app/checkout.tsx:128)`.
- `Intentional Changes` should be compact and easy to skim.
- `Coverage Ledger` must include every reviewed user-visible surface, not just surfaces with findings.
- `Evidence Appendix` may use small tables.
- If no user-visible regressions are found, still write the report:
  - Say the recommendation is `Pass` or `Pass with caveat`
  - Include an empty `Complete Findings Index`
  - Include the full `Coverage Ledger`
  - State the strongest blind spot
  - Document what was verified
- If the report is based mainly on static reasoning, say that plainly in both `Gate Snapshot` and `Coverage Ledger`.
- When evidence is mixed, write the verified code-path facts first, then the inferred user impact second.

## Behavior-Preserving Refactor Checklist

When the diff centralizes behavior behind a shared helper, adapter, wrapper, middleware, base class, hook, or common handler, check these explicitly before deciding it is "just a refactor":

- Source parity: did the user-visible behavior start reading from a different input, field, state slice, request payload, or serialized form?
- Guard parity: did auth, permission, debounce, duplicate-submit, confirmation, retry, ordering, or empty-state guards move, disappear, or become bypassable?
- Output parity: does the final renderer, exporter, request builder, CLI output, email body, or persisted record still consume the expected format and shape?
- Extension-point parity: if a local override, callback, prop, or branch was removed, is there a new path that preserves the same behavior, not just the same UI or API surface?
- Intent split: are telemetry-only, naming-only, or cleanup-only changes actually mixed with behavior changes in the same refactor?

For any user-visible flow, explicitly compare:

- user-visible input source
- transformed or intermediate payload
- final output or side effect
- gates that must still run before the effect happens

If those layers are no longer aligned, treat that as a regression lead even before runtime verification.

## Guardrails

- Do not call a deliberate product change a regression just because users will notice it.
- Do not mistake "tests passed" for "user impact disproven".
- Do not overcount the same symptom across multiple files.
- Do not hide lower-severity issues because stronger issues already exist.
- Do not claim complete coverage unless the coverage ledger accounts for every touched user-visible or unknown-impact surface.
- If a runtime check cannot be performed, say so and downgrade confidence rather than hiding the gap.
- Do not discard a strong static regression lead just because the change was introduced during a refactor or telemetry cleanup.
- Do not promote a finding to `Block` unless the user-visible breakage itself, not just the code smell, is strongly supported.

## Reference

- Use [references/report-template.md](references/report-template.md) as the default output shape.
